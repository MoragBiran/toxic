64,INFP,Everything about what you just wrote screams INFP.,0
64,INFP,Haha I am halfway through writing my speech on this topic as I'm reading this.  Locking people in cages is not the most effective way of dealing with the issue.,0
64,INFP,Yep.  I look back at all of my best friendships/relationships in the past (before I knew about MBTI) and they were all N's of some kind or another.,0

64,INFP,"So, I'm putting this in the INFP forum... well, because I want other INFP perspectives on what I'm going to say. This is kinda long.  I know this might border on typism but I think it's necessary to...",0
