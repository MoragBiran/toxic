This project is about identifying whether a person can be considered as "toxic" or "not-toxic" based on texts from social media (Twitter posts in this case). In this project we would also want to know whether types of people (types according to MBTI) can be labeled as toxic.
The data contains 498 different people divided into 16 distinct personality types where each line contains 50 tweets for each person, separated by "|||".
The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:
Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)
Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)
Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)
Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)
We will investigate each tweet which includes information about the personality or preferences of each person.
The prediction of whether a person is toxic is made using SVM model for classification.
